This is System Preferences, the configuration program for the Hawaii desktop.

Dependencies
============

In order to build and install System Preferences you will need Vibe.
The Vibe repository contains all the instructions to bring it up.

Build
=====

Building System Preferences is a piece of cake.

Assuming you are in the source directory, just create a build directory
and run cmake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/system ..

To do a debug build the last command can be:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/system -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

To do a release build instead it can be:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/system -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE parameter allows the following values:

    Debug: debug build
    Release: release build
    RelWithDebInfo: release build with debugging information


Installation
============

It's really, it's just a matter of typing:

    make install

from the build directory.
